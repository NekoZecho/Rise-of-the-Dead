A small unfinished 2D COD Zombies inspired project.

I made this as a first project in my game dev class with someone else for a group project. Decided to share a bit (mostly just to make it easier for friends to see lol).

UNFINISHED but still playable.

Controls:
Move - WASD or Arrow Keys
Fire (Click or Hold) - Left Mouse - or - CRTL
Pause - Esc
Flashlight Toggle - F
Bright Lights Toggle (debug feature but still)- Y
Buy Perk (when close enough) - E


All Sound and Font Assets belong to their respective owners (and were all free use).

(And yes, the zombies have no sound. Might change later, idk. Player Animations need work too.)


May or may not be a major rework coming soon. ;3
